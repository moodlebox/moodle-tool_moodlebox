A Moodle administration plugin providing a GUI to some settings and management of a [MoodleBox](https://moodlebox.net/), a Moodle server installed on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

This plugin enables a Moodle administrator to monitor some hardware settings, to set the date of the MoodleBox, to allow restart and shutdown of the MoodleBox and changing Raspberry Pi passwords using a GUI. After the installation in Moodle, some steps are required to complete on the Raspberry Pi (see below).

Administrators and users with manager role can moreover restart and shutdown the MoodleBox with buttons in the footer of each Moodle page.

The plugin is compatible with Moodle 3.6 or later. A Raspberry Pi model Zero 2 W, 3A+, 3B, 3B+, 4B or 5 is recommended.

## Installation

The MoodleBox plugin must be installed in the Moodle tree of the MoodleBox, in the _tool_ folder. Once installed, an new option _MoodleBox_ will be available in Moodle, under _Site administration > Server_ in the _Administration_ block.

To complete the installation, you have to configure some `direvent` jobs on the MoodleBox.

1. Install `direvent` package:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install direvent
    ```

1. Add following lines to file `/etc/direvent.conf`:
    ```bash
    # This is the configuration file for direvent. Read
    # direvent.conf(5) for more information about how to
    # fill this file.

    debug 0;

    watcher {
      path /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/;
      file .reboot-server;
      event CLOSE_WRITE;
      command "/sbin/shutdown -r now";
    }

    watcher {
      path /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/;
      file .shutdown-server;
      event CLOSE_WRITE;
      command "/sbin/shutdown -h now";
    }

    watcher {
      path /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/;
      file .set-server-datetime;
      event CLOSE_WRITE;
      command "/bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/.set-server-datetime";
    }

    watcher {
      path /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/;
      file .newpassword;
      event CLOSE_WRITE;
      command "/bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/bin/changepassword.sh";
    }

    watcher {
      path /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/;
      file .wifisettings;
      event CLOSE_WRITE;
      command "/usr/bin/python3 /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/bin/changewifisettings.py";
    }

    watcher {
      path /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/;
      file .resize-partition;
      event CLOSE_WRITE;
      command "/bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/bin/resizepartition.sh";
    }
    ```

1. Copy the following line at the end of file `/etc/sudoers.d/020_www-data-nopasswd` (create it if it's not here):
    ```bash
    www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/sbin/parted /dev/mmcblk0 unit MB print free
    www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/vcgencmd
    ```

1. If you use the [PiJuice module](https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice), you need to install the packages related
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install pijuice-base
    ```
   then allow www-data to access I2C:
    ```bash
    sudo adduser www-data i2c
    ```
   and reboot.
